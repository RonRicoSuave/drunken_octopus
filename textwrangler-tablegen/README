TableGen.plist

TableGen.plist contains a user-defined language for TextWrangler / BBEdit which enables highlighting and folding for LLVM TableGen (.td) files.  Unlike the samples included with LLVM (for vim and emacs), it sets many of the commonly used base classes, functions, and dag types as keywords.  If you just want base statements (class, multiclass, def, etc)  It is currently an early version, and all of the keywording is for target specific .td files.  It will not fold all definitions yet,  but this is being worked on.

Installing:
On Mac, copy this file to 
~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/
and restart TextWrangler.  BBEdit should be a similar install.
