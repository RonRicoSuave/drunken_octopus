TableGen.plist

TableGen.plist contains a user-defined language for TextWrangler / BBEdit which 
enables highlighting and (partial) folding for LLVM TableGen (.td) files.  
It is currently an early version, and most of the functionality is for Target 
specific files (particularly the Instruction definitions).  It will not fold 
all definitions, but this is being worked on. 

Installing:
On Mac, copy this file to 
~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/
and restart TextWrangler.  BBEdit should be a similar install.
